# About

My name is Fabian 'ryg' Giesen and this is my blog. I'm a systems programmer who likes math.
I currently work at [RAD Game Tools](http://www.radgametools.com) in Kirkland, WA. I'm also a member of the
[demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) group [Farbrausch](http://www.farbrausch.com)
and have contributed to several of their demos. Most of the code I write in my spare time is available
on [Github](https://github.com/rygorous).

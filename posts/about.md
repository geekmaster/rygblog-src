This is the blog of Fabian "ryg" Giesen. I work at [RAD Game Tools](http://www.radgametools.com) in Kirkland/WA as a programmer. I'm also active in the [demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) group [Farbrausch](http://www.farbrausch.com) and have written some useful tools and other pieces of code, most of which are available on my [homepage](http://www.farbrausch.com/~fg).

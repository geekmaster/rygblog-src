-title=Optimizing Software Occlusion Culling

In January of 2013, some nice folks at Intel released a [Software Occlusion
Culling demo](http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/samples/software-occlusion-culling)
with full source code. I spent about two weekends playing around with the code,
and after realizing that it made a great example for various things I'd been
meaning to write about for a long time, started churning out blog posts about
it for the next few weeks. This is the resulting series.

Here's the list of posts (the series is now finished):

1. "[%](*write_combining)", on typical write combining issues when writing graphics code.
2. "[%](*string_processing_rant)", a slightly over-the-top post that starts with some bad string processing habits and ends in a rant about what a complete minefield the standard C/C++ string processing functions and classes are whenever non-ASCII character sets are involved.
3. "[%](*cores_dont_share)", on some very common pitfalls when running multiple threads that share memory.
4. "[%](*fixing_cache_lazy)". You could redesign your system to be more cache-friendly --- but when you don't have the time or the energy, you could also just do this.
5. "[%](*frustum_culling_turning_crank)" --- on the other hand, if you do have the time and energy, might as well do it properly.
6. "[%](*barycentric_conspiracy)" is a lead-in to some in-depth posts on the triangle rasterizer that's at the heart of Intel's demo. It's also a gripping tale of triangles, MÃ¶bius, and a plot centuries in the making.
7. "[%](*tri_rast_in_practice)" --- how to build your own precise triangle rasterizer and *not* die trying.
8. "[%](*optimizing_basic_rasterizer)", because this is real time, not amateur hour.
9. "[%](*depth_buffers_done_quick_1)" --- at last, looking at (and optimizing) the depth buffer rasterizer in Intel's example.
10. "[%](*depth_buffers_done_quick_2)" --- optimizing some more!
11. "[%](*care_and_feeding_worker_threads_1)" --- this project uses multi-threading; time to look into what these threads are actually doing.
12. "[%](*care_and_feeding_worker_threads_2)" --- more on scheduling.
13. "[%](*reshaping_dataflows)" --- using global knowledge to perform local code improvements.
14. "[%](*speculatively_speaking)" --- on store forwarding and speculative execution, using the triangle binner as an example.
15. "[%](*mopping_up)" --- a bunch of things that didn't fit anywhere else.
16. "[The Reckoning](*occlusion_reckoning)" --- in which a lesson is learned, but [the damage is irreversible](http://www.alessonislearned.com/).

All the code is available on [Github](https://github.com/rygorous/intel_occlusion_cull/); there's
various branches corresponding to various (simultaneous) tracks of development,
including a lot of experiments that didn't pan out. The articles all reference
the [blog branch](https://github.com/rygorous/intel_occlusion_cull/tree/blog)
which contains only the changes I talk about in the posts --- i.e. the
stuff I judged to be actually useful.

Special thanks to Doug McNabb and Charu Chandrasekaran at Intel for publishing
the example with full source code and a permissive license, and for saying
"yes" when I asked them whether they were okay with me writing about my
findings in this way!
